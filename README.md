📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes Fitbit fitness tracker data to explore the relationship between daily activity, calories burned, and sleep quality. The project was completed as part of the Bellabeat case study for the Google Data Analytics Certificate.

🎯 Objective
The goal is to understand how physical activity and lifestyle factors (e.g., calories burned, intensity of activity) relate to sleep quality, and how Bellabeat can use these insights to improve its marketing strategy for health-conscious consumers.

🛠️ Tools and Technologies
R (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, lubridate)

Kaggle (data exploration platform)

GitHub (version control and project portfolio)

Excel (initial data cleaning)

📈 Key Findings
Higher calories burned during the day are associated with better sleep quality.

Increased intensity of activity (measured through intense minutes) correlates positively with better sleep duration and quality.

Individuals with more sedentary behavior during the day tend to have poorer sleep patterns.

🧠 Recommendations for Bellabeat
Promote fitness activities through the Bellabeat app to encourage better sleep habits.

Develop marketing content emphasizing the link between physical activity and improved sleep quality.

Target health-focused users by showcasing personalized activity recommendations tied to sleep improvements.
